## Things I've Built

### The Synaxis (WIP)

An open source multipurpose app for Orthodox Christians: daily lives of the saints, a quotes repository,
a place to generate saint quote images, and a calendar of services for every Metropolitan area. It is a full
stack app built using TypeScript, React, Next.js, tRPC, Drizzle, Postgres, and Tailwind. It was designed
using Figma and is deployed on Vercel. While it is not yet fully completed, it is in its final stages of
development.

Staging: https://staging.thesynaxis.com

### WPGravityBundle (No Longer Maintained)

I am the creator and maintainer of WPGravityBundle, an open source npm package. This package handles forms built with the WordPress plugin Gravity Forms in headless configurations of WordPress in React.js, using the plugins WPGraphQL and WPGraphQL for Gravity Forms. State, error validation, and your GraphQL mutation are all handled with this one package and two lines of code.I am the creator and maintainer of WPGravityBundle, an open source npm package.
