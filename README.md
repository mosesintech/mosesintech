## Things I've Built

### Blog Scraper
This was a simple app that I built so that I could read the blog of my favorite priest in print form.
Reading online isn't nearly as simple as it is to have a printed book, to me, so I resolved to print this priest's blog through Lulu.com for my personal library.

### WPGravityBundle (WIP)
Headless WordPress websites are my favorite projects to work on, and I feel that they may be the future of WordPress.
Gravity Forms is a WordPress plugin that gives you a very powerful dashboard to create your own forms.
WPGraphQL is a WordPress plugin that wraps WordPress in a GraphQL API so that you can query your data for the frontend of your website.
Personally, I use Gatsby.js for my headless projects.
Letting WordPress & Gravity Forms handle the functionality of forms is a boon for any headless WordPress site, and since I imagine that I'll be using this combo into the future, I decided to try to publish my own npm package called WPGravityBundle.
This package will take your Gravity Forms data, map through it to present the form fields and return the values when submitted, so you can plug them into your mutation.
This is currently a work in progress.

### The Synaxis
This is meant to be a series of web and mobile apps for Eastern Orthodox Christians.
First, I plan on building a quotes app that will deliver daily quotes from our saints.
It should also have Scripture references and allow you to compile your own list of quotations and export them according to your citation needs.
This, I hope, will be good for the layman, seminarians (for papers), and clergy (for homilies).
This app is being developed using Test Driven Development.

## My 3 Year Plan

I've come to realize that most of my experience in development has been solo project work.
This has been very fulfilling and I wouldn't take any of it back.
But I wish I could have spent more time working on a team.

I hope that in these next 3 years, I can spend time working on a development team, hopefully in the Headless WordPress space.

I hope that this time will help me to fill in awkward knowledge gaps developed in my time working solo.

I hope to write a series of articles on WordPress: using WP effectively for business, how to get the most out of your WP installation, and advanced WP topics.

I hope to soon begin to give talks at WP Camps, meetups, and live tech events so I can share with others the valuable knowledge I've come to find myself.

More than anything, I hope to become a better man, a good husband, and a great father.
