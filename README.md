## Things I've Built

### WPGravityBundle (WIP)
Headless WordPress websites are my favorite projects to work on, and I feel that they may be the future of WordPress.
Gravity Forms is a WordPress plugin that gives you a very powerful dashboard to create your own forms.
WPGraphQL is a WordPress plugin that wraps WordPress in a GraphQL API so that you can query your data for the frontend of your website.
Personally, I use Gatsby.js for my headless projects.
Letting WordPress & Gravity Forms handle the functionality of forms is a boon for any headless WordPress site, and since I imagine that I'll be using this combo into the future, I decided to try to publish my own npm package called WPGravityBundle.
This package will take your Gravity Forms data, map through it to present the form fields and return the values when submitted, so you can plug them into your mutation.
This is currently a work in progress.

### The Synaxis (WIP)
This is meant to be a series of web and mobile apps for Eastern Orthodox Christians.
First, I plan on building a quotes app that will deliver daily quotes from our saints.
It should also have Scripture references and allow you to compile your own list of quotations and export them according to your citation needs.
This, I hope, will be good for the layman, seminarians (for papers), and clergy (for homilies).
This app is being developed using Test Driven Development.
